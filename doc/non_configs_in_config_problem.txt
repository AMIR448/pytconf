What if I want to put non configs (class members, class methods etc...)
inside a config? Currently this is not supported (pyscrapers wanted to do
this and I disabled this since it does not work).

Why doesn't it work?
Because I save all Params objects outside the class and then connect them
to the variables according to the order. If there are variables which are
not params I don't know about them. I assume that there is a match between
number of params and number of member of the class.

What about the old design?
This was not a problem in the old design where we actaully assigned the
params to the variables but this was an ugly design which created issues
with syntax checkers.

Solution?
Currently I don't have one.
Maybe use descriptors (which I don't understnad in depth).
