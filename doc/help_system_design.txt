the help command should be just another command.
It should also be the default command such that
if you do not say any command you use the default command.

Here are the different ways to get help:
	[app] -> run default command (should be help)
	[app] help -> show help for entire app
	[app] help [function] -> show help for function [function]
	[app] help [function] [param] -> show help for param [param] of function [function]

We don't want to support this way:
	$ [app] [function] --help
	or
	$ [app] [function] help
	because this means that the function cannot have it's own --help flag (in the first case)
	or cannot handle a free argument with the contect "help" (in the second case).
