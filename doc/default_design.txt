What we want?
- that when defining configuration entries I will not need to do:
    ======================
    default=...,
    required=False,
    ======================
    because of I have a default then obviously the entry is not required.
    This means that:
           have default -> is not required
           required -> does not have default
    That means that I only want to have either an entry with no default
    or with a default
    And I want the system itself to deduce if the value is required or not.
- that I can supply a value in a config file even if the value is "without default/required"
    and this means that I *** would not *** need to supply it on the command line.
