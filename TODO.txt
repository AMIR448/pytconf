- do correct collection of arguments (--foo=bar and --foo bar)
- gather all the create_* function together into a static class.
	This will enable users to auto complete all the creators.
- once myenv supports more than one virtual env have this project
	have:
		- virtual env for 2.7 running.
		- virtual env for 3.6 running.
		- virtual env for development tools (pypitools etc).
- make each parameters have a suggester class attached. This will suggest
	values to a user that needs to put this parameter in.
- make each parameter have a gui attached to be filled by gui.
- make sure that we can easily create a app based on pytconf without much
	fanfare (groups, main etc).
