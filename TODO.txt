- do correct collection of arguments (--foo=bar and --foo bar)
- find how to make it easy for people using pytconf to find all the
	"create_XXX" functions.
	currently they have to import each one seperated.
	Maybe one static class that has all of these are members?
	Maybe the "Config" parent can have all of these as members?
	...
- gather all the create_* function together into a static class.
	This will enable users to auto complete all the creators.
- once myenv supports more than one virtual env have this project
	have:
		- virtual env for 2.7 running.
		- virtual env for 3.6 running.
		- virtual env for development tools (pypitools etc).
- make each parameters have a suggester class attached. This will suggest
	values to a user that needs to put this parameter in.
